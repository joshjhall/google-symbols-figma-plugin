# Disabled: Releases require manual .fig file generation and upload
# Use scripts/release.sh for manual releases instead
#
# Process:
# 1. Icon update PR is merged
# 2. Generate .fig files in Figma Desktop (~10-15 min)
# 3. Run: ./scripts/release.sh minor
# 4. Script creates release with all .fig files attached
#
# To re-enable automated releases (without .fig files):
# - Uncomment the 'on:' trigger below
# - Uncomment the 'jobs' section

# on:
#   push:
#     branches:
#       - main
